        <p>Hello! My name is Gonzalo Segovia and I am from Antofagasta, Chile. I enjoy
          playing role-playing video games with my friends and collecting cards.
          I'm currently studying web design and development at BYU. Sometimes I struggle
          to learn things, but I try hard to keep up. I'm excited to see where all this will take me.</p>

        <p>Antofagasta is a region of Chile. In Chile, we don't have 'states'. 
           It is located in the north of Chile near the desert. 
           It is a coastal city where one of the largest populations in the country is concentrated. 
           It has some natural monuments such as 'La Portada'.</p>
